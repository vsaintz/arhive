# ARhive

**ARhive** is a mobile AR app built with React Native and Expo that brings printed postcards of Sikkim’s cultural landmarks to life. Designed as an educational and preservation tool, the app uses augmented reality (AR) and audio playback to offer a deeper, more immersive way to experience local heritage.

When users scan a postcard through the app, they see historical facts appear as augmented overlays and hear spoken stories in native dialects. This interaction transforms a simple printed postcard into a living cultural artifact—blending visual storytelling with indigenous voices. Whether you're a traveler, student, or resident of the region, the app invites you to rediscover Sikkim's past through technology.

The core idea behind the app is to promote **language preservation, cultural education, and digital storytelling** using free, accessible tools. By combining AR with local language audio, we aim to preserve oral histories that are at risk of fading and make them accessible to younger generations.

Key features include:
- **AR Postcard Scanning**: Point your camera at supported postcards to trigger visual overlays with contextual information.
- **Audio Narration in Local Dialects**: Hear stories and historical facts narrated in native Sikkimese languages, helping preserve linguistic diversity.
- **Simple, Mobile-First Design**: Built with Expo and React Native, the app works smoothly on both Android and iOS through the Expo Go environment.

The project is deeply rooted in the belief that **technology can support cultural memory**, not replace it. With every scan, users not only learn about monuments and legends but also reconnect with the languages and traditions that define the region.

This is an ongoing project, open to contributions, translations, and content suggestions from educators, locals, and developers interested in cultural preservation through AR
